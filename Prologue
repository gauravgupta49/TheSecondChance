'How would you describe this cafe?'
'Umm, let me see. Yeah, if we take a left from the main road and travel 50 yards, on the left you would see a cafe named Strings. 
It's a house property converted into a cafe, a rather beautful one. It's two storeyed and they have a verandah on the 1st floor and a small garden 
on the ground floor where you can retreat for a break. There are lots of books kept which one can read. People also group here for casual and romantic

"Nothing. How would you describe this cafe?"

"Ummm. Even though just a bit far from the hustle bustle of the main road, the cafe was located at a place that could be described as a serene locality.

had an aura quite unique. One could not help but form some sort of strings or connection with this place and the people they met here."

"You sound poetic"

"Poetic?"

"Or artistic... like the prologue of a romantic novel."

"Oh. How many have you read?"

"None" 
But soon he was going to get featured in one.
And that my friends, was little poetic.
