Amay procured a couple of cookies, walked to the cafe entrance and then sat on the footsteps of the entrance to relish his cookie in solitude 
whilst sitting in the lap of nature. He had hardly finished half of his cookie when he saw a labrador in front of him at a few arms distance. He looked at
the lab's leashed collar and then looked on both sides of the road to spot the lax owner. While there was no one in Amay's sight, lab's sight was fixated on
the cookie. And so Amay did what he felt was best in this unprecedented scenario. He offered his cookie to the lab and the offer was joyously accepted.
